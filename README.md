# Matplotlib - The Power of Plots

## Pymaceuticals

The purpose of this project is to analyze data from the most recent animal study for screening potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occuring form of 
skin cancer. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological response were then monitored over the course of
that time. The objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare. 

Data analysis was performed with Pandas and the results were shown through Matplotlib Plots using Jupyter Notebook. 
1. Multiple scatter plots were created that show:  
    * how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment
    * how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) site changes over time for each treatment
    * the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
2. A bar graph that compares the total % tumor change for each drug across the full 45 days

The conclusion derived from the Analysis:
*  ‘Capomulin’ stands out as the drug having the most potential for success in treatment of SCC in mice.  Tumor volume decreased by -19% while metastatic spread increased from 0.0 to 1.47 and survival rate stood at 84% at the end of 45 days of treatment with ‘Capomulin’. This is much better in comparison with the other 3 drugs namely ‘Infubinol’, ‘Ketapril’ or ‘Placebo’.
